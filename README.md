# AspiringMinds
An analysis of the Aspiring Minds data-set with Machine Learning
## Project Context
The education system in India is different from that of the United States in many aspects. Students in US educational institutions have the option of picking elective courses of their choice and interest which helps them  in  understanding what  career  path  to  pursue.  In India,  most educational  institutions  do  not  offerthe same flexibility when it comes toelective courses. As a result,students often find it difficult to gauge their actual professional interests. In  India,  undergraduate  engineering  students  do  not  have the  frequent  and  easy access  to  career  fairs (like  the  ones  organized  in  US  universities)  and  this  adds  to  their  confusion  when  it  comes  to  deciding what role would be best suited to them as a career. Engineering colleges in India simply invite a plethora of  companies  to  hire  students  for  different  full-time  roles  and  students  apply  to  these  roles  without completely understanding these roles. The  four  of  us  have  faced  the above-mentionedproblems  ourselves  and  we  feel  that  undergraduate engineering students could benefit from a model that could help them identify roles that are best suited to the them. This can be done keeping in mind the academic scores of a student which gives an indication of the strengths, weaknesses and possible interests of the student.Our project takes the help of Aspiring Minds, an organization that conducts aptitude tests (AMCATs) for engineering  students.  Aspiring  Minds  has  tie-ups  with  various  technical  companies  which hire  students based on a student’s AMCAT performance, academic profiles and overall profiles. We intend to talk about all this in greater detail in our final project report.
## Primary Questions
1. Given a student's academic scores, what are common types of positions that may be suitable for her/him at their preferred location and what could be the expected salary for those positions?
2. Given a student’s academic scores,other demographic information and desired job designation and  salary,  what  specific  academic  score  must  the  student  improve  upon  to  increase  her/his chances of landing the desired job and by how much?
3. Do people of different genders get different salaries despite having similar scores? Are there other factors that need to be controlled in order to strengthen the correlation?
